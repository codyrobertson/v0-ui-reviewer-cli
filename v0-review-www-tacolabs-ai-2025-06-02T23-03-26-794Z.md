## 2. Heuristic & WCAG Audit

| # | Element | Issue | Guideline Violated | Impact | Effort |
|---|---------|-------|--------------------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Hero CTA | Low contrast orange button with no hover state | WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast, Visibility of System Status | 🔴 | 💧 |
| 2 | Feature Tabs | No visual indication of which tab is active | Nielsen's Visibility of System Status | 🟡 | 💧 |
| 3 | Overall Layout | Too much vertical scrolling before reaching actionable content | Nielsen's Flexibility & Efficiency of Use | 🔴 | 🌧️ |
| 4 | Testimonials | Lacks specificity and detailed results | Nielsen's Match Between System & Real World | 🟡 | 💧 |
| 5 | Feature Cards | Inconsistent heights and alignment | Visual Hierarchy & Consistency | 🟢 | 💧 |
| 6 | Multiple CTAs | Same "Experience AI power" CTA repeated verbatim | Redundancy & Cognitive Load | 🟡 | 💧 |
| 7 | Mobile View | Text appears small and potentially difficult to read | WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text | 🟡 | 🌧️ |
| 8 | Value Props | Abstract benefits without concrete examples | Nielsen's Help Users Recognize & Recover from Errors | 🔴 | 🌧️ |

## 3. Recommendations

#### Quick Wins
1. **Improve CTA contrast and visibility** 🔴💧 - Replace the orange button with a higher contrast color (dark blue #1E3A8A) and add hover effects to increase clickability.
2. **Add active state to feature tabs** 🟡💧 - Create clear visual distinction for the active tab with an underline and color change.
3. **Consolidate testimonials** 🟡💧 - Combine the scattered testimonials into a dedicated social proof section with more specific results and company names.
4. **Add specific industry examples** 🔴💧 - Include industry-specific use cases to help visitors self-identify their needs.
5. **Implement progressive disclosure** 🟡💧 - Collapse longer sections and allow users to expand only what interests them.

#### Deeper Redesign
- **Restructure the page flow** 🔴🌧️ - Move the "How AI Can Help Your Business" section higher, immediately after the hero to establish relevance faster.
- **Create a solution finder** 🔴🌧️ - Add a simple 2-3 question interactive element that guides users to the most relevant solution for their business size/type.
- **Implement a sticky mini-CTA** 🟡💧 - Add a small, persistent CTA that follows scroll to capture interest at any point.
- **Redesign feature cards** 🟡💧 - Use a consistent card design with clearer icons, equal heights, and more specific benefit statements.
- **Add a ROI calculator** 🔴⛈️ - Create an interactive tool that helps prospects calculate potential time/money savings.

#### Accessibility
- **Increase color contrast** 🔴💧 - Ensure all text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
- **Add proper ARIA labels** 🟡💧 - Ensure all interactive elements have proper aria-labels for screen readers.
- **Improve tab navigation** 🟡💧 - Ensure the entire site is navigable via keyboard with visible focus states.
- **Add alt text to all images** 🟡💧 - Ensure testimonial photos and icons have descriptive alt text.

## 5. A/B Test Ideas

* **Hypothesis 1**: Replacing the abstract "10 Extra Hours" headline with a specific industry-based headline (e.g., "How Marketing Agencies Save 10+ Hours Weekly with TacoLabs AI") will increase conversion rates by 15-20% for visitors from that industry.
  
* **Hypothesis 2**: Adding a "See It In Action" video demonstration above the fold will increase time on page by 40% and conversion rates by 25% by making the abstract AI benefits more concrete.

* **Hypothesis 3**: Implementing a 3-step mini-assessment that provides a personalized ROI calculation will increase conversion rates by 30% by helping visitors quantify the potential value.
